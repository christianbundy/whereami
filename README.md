# whereami

This is a quick one-liner that tells you who and where you are in a color-coded format that doubles as an SSH URI scheme. The `@` and `:` symbols are dimmed for readability, but will still appear when [piped](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man2/pipe.2.html) or used in conjunction with [pbcopy](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/darwin/reference/manpages/man1/pbcopy.1.html).
